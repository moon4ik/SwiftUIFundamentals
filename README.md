**App 1 Weather:** 
<br><i>We learn the absolute basics of SwiftUI to build the user interface of a weather app. If you have experience with SwiftUI, feel free to skip this one as it's very beginner friendly.</i>

**App 2 - Apple Frameworks:**
<br><i>We learn to build a Grid and pass data from our main view to a detail view.</i>

**App 3 - Barcode Scanner:**
<br><i>We learn to use UIViewRepresentable to connect SwiftUI and UIKit in case SwiftUI doesn't support a type of user interface you want.</i>

**App 4 - Appetizers:**
<br><i>This app is a big one where we put it all our learnings together to build a proper SwiftUI app that works with a network call (updated to Async/Await in iOS 15).</i>
